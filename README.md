# Health-Tracker
This app uses Machine Learning to identify the food you ate. It then brings up nutritional information. Clicking Add Food adds it to your total count. If your intake of Sodium, Cholesterol, Fats, Proteins or calories is over your RDI a checkmark appears next to the food.

I got the inspiration for this app from Hackathons. During Hackathons one consumes copious amounts of junk food and it would be nice to know the extent of the unhealthy. 

Future:
-Connecting this to the REST database
-Adding a graphing feature with CorePlot to show your intake over several days
